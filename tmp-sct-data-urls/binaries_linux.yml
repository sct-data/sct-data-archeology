    message: 'Normalize binaries'' package name.


      Previously we treated linux as two kinds of beasts: Debian and CentOS 6.

      But we conflated Debian with all other linuxes, so really it was "linux"

      and "centos6".


      Going forward, I want to do builds the way PyPI does with manylinux [1]:

      the oldest CentOS is considered linux full stop. With my recent rebuild,

      that is CentOS 7. Update the package name to emphasize this clearly.


      I picked CentOS 7 because that''s the oldest version that ANTS will build

      on, but I''m temporarily keeping a special case for CentOS 6 for the next

      ~6 months until it end-of-lifes.

    message: 'Update ANTS binaries.


      These binaries were built via a Github Workflow.

      The Linux binaries were built on centos7, which is the oldest Linux that

      ANTS will still compile on. The MacOS binaries were built on the Github

      MacOS VMs.

      The other binaries were copied unchanged from the previous binaries.


      For full details see Github PR #2642 and Issue #2669.
